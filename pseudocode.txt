The Route:

I will be making a known route for the drone where it does not interfere
with people's ability of moving from place to place. 

Step 1:
    Takeoff to reasonable height,
    Turn clockwise until the drone has detected something,
Step 2:
    if detection is made clear, 
        stop rotating
        move forward
Step 3:
    if drone is within X cm in height
        land
